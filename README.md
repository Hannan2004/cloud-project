# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Automation with React, Node.js, Docker, Jenkins & GCP

This project showcases a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** for a full-stack web application using **React (frontend)**, **Node.js (backend)**, and **MongoDB Atlas**. The application is containerized using **Docker**, with a Jenkins-driven pipeline for automated builds, image storage, and deployment to **Google Cloud Run**. All artifacts are stored securely in **Google Artifact Registry**.
